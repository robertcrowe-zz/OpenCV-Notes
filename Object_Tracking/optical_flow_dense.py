Optical Flow

Requires OpenCV 3.X and FFMPEG 3.X

Seeks to get the pattern of apparent motion of objects in an image between two consecutive frames.
Shows the distribution of the apparent velocities of objects in an image. 

OpenCV has two implementations of Optical Flow.

1. Lucas-Kanade Differential Method - Tracks some keypoints in the video, good for corner-like 
features (tracking cars from drones)

    https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15385-s12/www/lec_slides/Baker&Matthews.pdf

2. Dense Optical Flow - Slower, but computes the optical flow for all points in a frame, unlike 
Lucas-Kanade which uses corner features (sparse dataset). Colors are used to reflect movement 
with Hue being direction and value (brightness/intensity) being speed.
