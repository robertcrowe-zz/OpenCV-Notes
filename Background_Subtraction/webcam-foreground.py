Background Subtraction

This is a very useful computer vision technique which allows 
us to separate foregrounds from the backgrounds in a video stream.

These algorithms essentially learn about the frame in view 
(video stream) and are able to accurate learn and identify 
the foreground mask. What results is a binary segmentation of the 
image which highlights regions of non-stationary objects.

There are a several Background subtraction algorithms in OpenCV 
specifically for video analysis:

BackgroundSubtractorMOG - Gaussian Mixture-based background/foreground 
Segmentation Algorithm.

BackgroundSubtractorMOG2 â€“ Another Gaussian Mixture-based background 
subtraction method, however with better adaptability to illumination 
changes and with better ability to detect shadows!

Geometric Multigrid (GMG) -This method combines statistical background 
image estimation and per-pixel Bayesian segmentation
